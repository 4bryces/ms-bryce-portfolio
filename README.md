## About Me
My name is Olivia Bryce and I am a senior at Saint Michael’s College with a double major in Secondary Education and Mathematics. I’m from Cambridge, Vermont, and I graduated from Lamoille Union High School in 2014. In high school I always helped classmates with their math homework, then one day a friend of mine said, “I like that you explained to me how to do this, rather than doing it for me. Have you ever thought of becoming a math teacher?” That’s when it all started.

During high school I privately tutored a 6th grade home schooled student who needed more advanced math than what was offered to her in public school. When I was a senior in high school I created an independent study where I assisted in teaching a 9th grade Algebra class. This was an incredible experience to verify that this is the right career path for me, and during this study I had the opportunity to observe different teaching styles, technology integration, and hands-on activities pertaining to mathematics. I’ve also had the opportunity to teach math instruction while being a substitute teacher at Lamoille Union Middle School, where I taught exponent rules to a group of seventh and eighth grade students. This was by far one of my favorite teaching experiences, because this wonderful group of middle school students were genuinely excited about learning! The way the students asked such great questions and really cared about understanding the behind a mathematics concept has geared my interest toward teaching at the middle level.

At Saint Michael’s College I am a peer tutor for a calculus class, which I’ve been doing for 5 semesters. I’ve found that my passion for teaching math roots from the infamous “lightbulb moment” we all hear about. When a student understands a concept you can see it in the way their facial expression changes, as they see math in a new light. This moment is what makes me so happy and it is the reason I love teaching!

Outside the classroom I love to get involved in extracurricular activities around campus. I am the Co-President of the Random Acts of Kindness Club, I’m a tour guide, I participate in extended service trips through our school’s volunteering programs, I have a radio show at the campus radio station, I’m involved in planning a retreat through campus ministry, and as I mentioned earlier I am a peer tutor. In addition, I love to play the ukulele, solve Rubik’s cubes, swim, play sports, and spend time with my cats and cows at home.

## My Goals

### My Professional Goals

**My first goal is to continue to discover technology that would enhance the mathematics classroom.**

The Education Department 1:1 initiative has provided me with the exciting opportunity to dive into various technology tools that enhance the experience of learning and make it more accessible to different types of learners. This technology initiative is something that I have been interested in throughout my time at Saint Michael’s, and this semester I hope to find five more math resources that I could use in my classroom. I have become comfortable with apps that are great for delivering the instruction and apps that are great for note taking, however I hope to find more that are specifically able to enhance the mathematics classroom. 

**My second goal is to create and facilitate a safe, comfortable, and supportive environment in my classroom.**

During the summer I work at a camp for kids with special needs, and most of them have had traumatic experiences in their lives or have extreme instability at home. When they arrive at camp it is a new place for them, and the way we provide unconditional positive regard and show support to all campers throughout camp is what allows them to feel comfortable and safe enough to open up and share their personalities with everybody. 
I want to bring this to my classroom because many students come from backgrounds in which do not provide them with the support they need in order to succeed. Most students spend nearly two decades within the walls of a school building, and in order for their personal growth and learning to thrive, they must feel a sense of comfort and safety when they are in their learning environment. In order to do this I will continue my study of Inclusive Classroom where I will build my knowledge of creating a classroom atmosphere where students are comfortable asking for help, contributing to class discussions, and collaborating with their peers. I will also show students support by reinforcing that they are smart, capable, and awesome individuals who can do anything they set their mind to! Often times students are missing positive encouragement from their teachers, and letting students know that you believe in them can go a long way!

**My third goal is to learn more about what Standards Based Learning looks like within a classroom.**

Though I have learned about Standards Based Learning through my studies at Saint Michael’s College, I have yet to look more into how the process is carried out by current teachers. Throughout this semester at my placement, I will observe the grading and reporting process and ask about how SBL works best for current public school educators. In particular, I want to know more about how to offer students a variety of ways to show their learning, and how to manage a classroom full of students that work at different paces. All learners are unique, and through my experience as a tutor and a substitute teacher, I see how much the pace at which students understand concepts varies. With SBL learners are able to move at their own pace, however I want to know more about how to best support each student with what they are learning when they are at different places in the material. This is something that I will understand more about through my Inclusive Classroom and Approaches to Teaching classes this semester.

### My Personal Goals

**My first personal goal is to keep my notes and classwork more organized this semester.**

In semesters past I have had a system of organization, however in order to prepare myself for being an educator, I must work on further developing my organization skills. I have set up folders on my iPad notes app and Google Drive for each class, bought a planner for meetings and important events that I update at least twice per week, and I keep a copy of my day-to-day schedule with me at all times. Through my classes this semester I hope to improve my organization of notes and classwork.

**My second personal goal is to work on my body language in a professional setting.**

Many people gather a first impression of somebody based on their body language. I want to be able to walk into a job interview with the proper body language that will give employers the right impression. I want for my body language to communicate to others that I am interested in what they are saying. Students will be more open to asking for help if I show them that I care about what they have to say, so this is something that carries into the classroom as well. My posture when I sit is not proper and I struggle to sit still for a long amount of time, which is something I want to significantly work on this semester. I also want to learn more about nonverbal cues that let others know that I will listen to what they have to say. 

**My third personal goal is to spend more time outdoors.**

I love spending time outside, generally while interacting with animals, and many times I find myself too caught up in schoolwork to schedule time to spend enjoying being outdoors. In addition to spending time outside, I'd like to start brainstorming ideas of how to bring math instruction outside the classroom. Many students benefit from a change in scenery, and providing them with an outdoor learning experience would help to engage students further in the material. One idea I have is to create a lesson on the Fibonacci Sequence where students will find spiral patterns in nature and be able to analyze them in terms of mathematical patterns.
